Subject: [PATCH] Throw exception when IV is used with ECB or CTR

The IV parameter is currently ignored when initializing
a cipher in ECB or CTR mode.

For CTR mode, it is confusing: it takes some time to see
that a different parameter is needed (the counter).

For ECB mode, it is outright dangerous.

This patch forces an exception to be raised.
